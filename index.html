        <p>The Infinite Build has the spirit of hackathons—the energy, creativity, and collaboration—but structured for ongoing projects. No competitions, no pitching, no pressure. Just builders, building, with each other's help, at a pace that works for them.</p>

        <h3>Fundamentally Different</h3>
         <p>Most programs end up extractive, because they're built to capture developers for someone else’s goals.  Infinite Build is <em>anti-capture</em>: built for <strong>journey enablement</strong> in the direction you choose. You control who you work with, what you build, and where value flows. No rigid cycles, no sponsored libraries, no artificial scarcity, no asymmetries.  In fact, there is no "us" vs "you", we're just builders supporting each other.</p>
        <h3>Work In Progress</h3>
        <p>We're building this as we go. Here are some of the pieces in the works.

      <div class="one-half column" >
        <h3>Perpetual Progress</h3>
        <p><strong>Fusion</strong> is swiping game that connects builders naturally, for a specific event. Choose who to learn from or work with—based on their experience or questions. The groups are formed with full privacy using MPC. No forced teams, no awkwardness, just small, introvert-friendly groups.
        <p><strong>Fission</strong> is a group mechanism that keeps things flexible. If ideas diverge or groups grow too large, members can split constructively, forming new groups while staying connected to the original. 
        <p>Together, they enable convergence and divergence, continuously opening space for collaboration and growth.</p>

          <h3>Navigating Your Path</h3>
           <p>Building can feel isolating. <strong>The Continuum</strong> offers a monthly rhythm of events to keep you moving. It’s all optional and responsive, starting with what you need. Monthly hackathon-style weekends offer momentum. Weekly get-togethers for tips and encouragement.  Or just stay in chat. A little chatbot called <strong>Phase Shift</strong> helps make connections you need right now. 
        <p>It’s not a track or curriculum; it’s a place to find what you need, when you need it.

        <h3>Unique Journeys</h3>
        <p>When a few people want to explore ideas or build together-say learning Rust, prototyping ZK libraries, or designing composable games-<strong>Vectors</strong> are lightweight, emphemeral groups for co-creating the experience.
        <p><strong>Beacons</strong>  are invitations placed by builders—quick tasks or learning paths that prepare someone to work with you. Complete one and you're ready to collaborate. Anyone can place a beacon. The first one gets you started. After that, you'll find beacons placed by other builders, each one another way in, another group forming.</p>

        <h3>Let's Build Better</h3>
        <p>The levers are in your hands. Beacons, Vectors, Fusion, Fission—builders place them, join them, split from them. The structure stays open because builders control the boundaries..</p>
