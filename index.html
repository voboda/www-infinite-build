        <p>An always-on hackathon without competitions, pitch decks, or sponsored funnels. A peer-run network built to resist capture: follow your own direction, choose your own collaborators, keep your value flows sovereign. Everything is opt-in, fork-friendly, and meant for you to build your own experience.</p>

        <h3>Where we come from</h3>
         <p>Started by hackathon regulars, serial winners, and cryptography nerds who wanted to go beyond weekend bursts towarards ongoing collaboration. We want a place to learn cool things, share as we go, and build useful things that find their way into people's hands.</p>

        <p><i>(Work in progress — we’re building the place we always wished existed.)</i></p>
        <h3>Perpetual Progress</h3>
        <p><strong>Fusion</strong> is swiping game that connects builders naturally, for a specific event. Choose who to learn from or work with—based on their experience or questions. The groups are formed with full privacy using MPC. No forced teams, no awkwardness, just small, introvert-friendly groups.
        <p><strong>Fission</strong> is a group mechanism that keeps things flexible. If ideas diverge or groups grow too large, members can split constructively, forming new groups while staying connected to the original. 
        <p>Together, they enable convergence and divergence, continuously opening space for collaboration and growth.</p>

          <h3>Navigating Your Path</h3>
           <p>Building can feel isolating. <strong>The Continuum</strong> is a stream to help you keep moving. Monthly hackathon-style weekends offer momentum. Weekly get-togethers where we screenshare our CLIs and IDEs for tips and encouragement.  Or just stay in chat, ask for help when you need it, and find the connections you need right now.

        <h3>Unique Journeys</h3>
        <p>When a few people want to explore ideas or build together-say learning Rust, prototyping ZK libraries, or designing composable games-<strong>Vectors</strong> are lightweight, emphemeral groups for co-creating the experience.
        <p><strong>Beacons</strong>  are invitations placed by builders—quick tasks or learning paths that prepare someone to work with you. Complete one and you're ready to collaborate. Anyone can place a beacon. The first one gets you started. After that, you'll find beacons placed by other builders, each one another way in, another group forming.</p>

        <h3>Let's Build Better</h3>
        <p>The levers are in your hands. Beacons, Vectors, Fusion, Fission—builders place them, join them, split from them. The structure stays open because builders control the boundaries..</p>
