        <p>The Infinite Build is an always-on hackathon. But no competitions, no pitch decks, no sponsored rats-races. Just hacking, collaborating, and learning from each other.

        <h3>Who we are</h3>
         <p>A builder-run network built to resist capture. Most “dev programs” exist to funnel developers toward someone else’s roadmap. Infinite Build does the opposite. It exists so you can pursue your direction, with your crew, and keep your value flows sovereign. The structure itself is anti-extractive: peer-to-peer, fork-friendly, opt-in at every layer.</p>
              <h3>Why we're different</h3>
         <p>We aren’t a foundation or a venture-adjacent community pretending to be grassroots. Infinite Build was started by hackathon regulars, repeat winners, and cryptography obsessives who were tired of chasing weekend-long adrenaline bursts that never turned into real collaboration. We wanted a place to learn hard things together, teach what we know, and build useful systems.</p>
        <h3>Work In Progress</h3>
        <p>We're building this as we go. Here are some of the pieces in the works.

        <h3>Perpetual Progress</h3>
        <p><strong>Fusion</strong> is swiping game that connects builders naturally, for a specific event. Choose who to learn from or work with—based on their experience or questions. The groups are formed with full privacy using MPC. No forced teams, no awkwardness, just small, introvert-friendly groups.
        <p><strong>Fission</strong> is a group mechanism that keeps things flexible. If ideas diverge or groups grow too large, members can split constructively, forming new groups while staying connected to the original. 
        <p>Together, they enable convergence and divergence, continuously opening space for collaboration and growth.</p>

          <h3>Navigating Your Path</h3>
           <p>Building can feel isolating. <strong>The Continuum</strong> offers a monthly rhythm of events to keep you moving. Monthly hackathon-style weekends offer momentum. Weekly get-togethers where we screenshare our CLIs and IDEs for tips and encouragement.  Or just stay in chat. A little chatbot called <strong>Phase Shift</strong> helps make connections you need right now. 
        <p>It’s not a track or curriculum; it’s a place to find what you need, when you need it.

        <h3>Unique Journeys</h3>
        <p>When a few people want to explore ideas or build together-say learning Rust, prototyping ZK libraries, or designing composable games-<strong>Vectors</strong> are lightweight, emphemeral groups for co-creating the experience.
        <p><strong>Beacons</strong>  are invitations placed by builders—quick tasks or learning paths that prepare someone to work with you. Complete one and you're ready to collaborate. Anyone can place a beacon. The first one gets you started. After that, you'll find beacons placed by other builders, each one another way in, another group forming.</p>

        <h3>Let's Build Better</h3>
        <p>The levers are in your hands. Beacons, Vectors, Fusion, Fission—builders place them, join them, split from them. The structure stays open because builders control the boundaries..</p>
        <div class="row center">
        <p>There's no application form to join. No evaluators or judges. Your first step is an <a href="https://welcome.infinite.build/">API call.</a></p>
